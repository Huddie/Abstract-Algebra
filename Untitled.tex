\subsection{Several equations}\index{Theorems!Several Equations}
This is a theorem consisting of several equations.

\begin{theorem}[Name of the theorem]
In $E=\mathbb{R}^n$ all norms are equivalent. It has the properties:
\begin{align}
& \big| ||\mathbf{x}|| - ||\mathbf{y}|| \big|\leq || \mathbf{x}- \mathbf{y}||\\
&  ||\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbf{x}_i||\leq \sum_{i=1}^n||\mathbf{x}_i||\quad\text{where $n$ is a finite integer}
\end{align}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Single Line}\index{Theorems!Single Line}
